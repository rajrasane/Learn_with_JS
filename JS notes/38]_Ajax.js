// Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)

// - AJAX is a web development trick that helps parts of a webpage change without reloading everything.
// It lets web browsers talk to servers in the background, so users don't have to wait for the whole page to reload.
// This makes web pages more lively and responsive.
